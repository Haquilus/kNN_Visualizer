#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

How to use:
Option 1
First, (if not already done) install python. Then, open the installation directory in a terminal, and install the 
required libraries as per the note in main.py. Finally, run main.py

Option 2
Run kNN Visualizer.exe, then enter the number of points and nearest neighbors you want the program to use. Currently,
however, kNN Visualizer.exe is out of date. This method is not recommended.

How to import your own points:
Install the prerequisites to run the code.
In objects.py, you can create a new array of points and their colors, then import it to main and set it equal to 
pointsArray.
Finally, run the program.
